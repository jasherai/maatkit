README for MySQL::Diff

                              MySQL::Diff
                              ===========

MySQL::Diff is Perl module for comparing the table structure
of two MySQL databases.

Shameless plug
--------------

This software was originally written as part of the
<http://www.guideguide.com/> project.  If you like hacking Perl in a
cool environment, come and work for us!

Prerequisites
-------------

This suite probably requires Perl 5.005 or higher.

Availability
------------

The latest version of MySQL::Diff is available from

  http://adamspiers.org/computing/mysqldiff/

and eventually (a possibly slightly older version) from the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN).  Visit
<http://www.perl.com/CPAN> to find a CPAN site near you.

Installation
------------

See INSTALL.

Documentation
-------------

See: http://adamspiers.org/computing/mysqldiff/

At some stage I'll get round to including proper POD-format
documentation and tests.  (Patches welcome ;-)

Support
-------

Questions, bug reports, useful code bits, and suggestions for
MySQL::Diff should just be sent to me at <mysqldiff@adamspiers.org>.

Known bugs
----------

Reported by users and confirmed:

  * Reference to non-existant routine maybe_index_auto_col().
    Huh?!  [John Violette]

Reported by users but unconfirmed:

  * If '-P1 3337' is one of the arguments it doesn't seem to get
    passed to the arguments for mysqldump (according to the
    debugging).  [Darrell Taylor]

  * # mysqldiff --user=root --password=xxxx -B demo tables.sql
    Duplicate specification "password|p:s" for option "p"
    Duplicate specification "password1|p1:s" for option "p1"
    Duplicate specification "password2|p2:s" for option "p2"
    [John Smith]

All easy to fix but I'm so short on time!  Patches welcome ...
