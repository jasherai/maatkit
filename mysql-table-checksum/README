Changelog:

2007-05-16: version 1.1.5

   Incompatible changes:
   * Output includes a new CHUNK column.
   * When using --replicate, the specified table structure needs a new 'chunk' column.

   Changes:
   * Added --chunksize and --chunkcol options to checksum tables in chunks.
   * Added --sleep option to pause between checksum queries.
   * Added --emptyrepltbl option to empty --replicate table before starting work.
   * Added --defaults-file option to read a given MySQL options file.
   * Check for existence of --replicate table before starting work.
   * Updated mysql-checksum-filter to handle the new CHUNK column in the output.
   * More documentation.
   * More tests in the test suite.

   Bugs fixed:
   * The output in --replicate mode had an empty string in CHECKSUM when the
     table had no rows (bad for scriptability).
   * The --optxor optimization was broken and always disabled itself.

2007-05-05: version 1.1.0

   * Added a way to do checksums on slaves via replication.
   * Added a row-order-independent BIT_XOR checksum algorithm.
   * Much better documentation, which reflects more logically designed program.
   * Added compatibility options for MySQL 3.23.58 through 6.0 alpha.
   * Added a test suite.
   * As per Heikki Tuuri, InnoDB and other engines can do CHECKSUM TABLE since 4.1.1
   * Made existing ACCUM user-variable algorithm work with SELECT and INSERT.
   * Changed default behavior for --count to avoid extra COUNT(*) query.
   * Added --algorithm, --askpass, --defaults-file, --index, --replicate, and --separator options.
   * Added warnings if the cmdline options are wrong.
   * Don't fork when there is only one host.
   * Speed and query optimizations.
