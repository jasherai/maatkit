=head1 NAME

mysql-checksum-filter - Filter checksums from mysql-table-checksum

=head1 OVERVIEW

This program takes the unsorted, verbose output from mysql-table-checksum and
sorts it, then filters it so you only see lines that have different checksums
or counts.

You can pipe input directly into it from mysql-table-checksum, or you can save
the mysql-table-checksum's output and run mysql-checksum-filter on the resulting file(s).  If
you run it against just one file, or pipe output directly into it, it'll output
results during processing.  Processing multiple files is slightly more
expensive, and you won't see any output until they're all read.

Of course, you could also process multiple files like this:

 cat file1 file2 file3 | sort -u | mysql-checksum-filter

but that still doesn't output anything until all files are read.

If you give the -m argument, mysql-checksum-filter will sort lines for that host first, so
you can see the checksum values on the master server before the slave.

If you give the -v argument, mysql-checksum-filter will always output all lines (but not
header lines).  You might want to do this in combination with -m.
