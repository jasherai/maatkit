== INSTALLATION

   To install maatkit, choose one of the following methods:

   ===== INSTALL FROM A TARBALL

      If you install from the tarball, extract the tarball and go into the
      resulting directory:

         tar zxvf <package>-<version>.tar.gz
         cd <package>-<version>

      Generate the makefile, which will check Perl module dependencies and
      so forth:

         perl Makefile.PL

      Install the program and man page:

         make install

      To remove the files, simply run:

         make uninstall

   To install to a directory other than your system's default, such as your
   home directory, generate the Makefile with a prefix:

      perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

   ===== ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS

      Simply unpack the zip or tarball file from Google Code and run the
      scripts from within a command prompt.

== DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is embedded in each program in POD, the Perl documentation
format.  To read the documentation, issue `perldoc <program>' where <program>
is the Perl script itself.
