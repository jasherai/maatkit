PURPOSE

   This package is a sandbox for testing features under any version of
   MySQL from 3.23 to 6.0.
   It will install one node under your home directory, and it will
   provide
   some useful commands to start, use and stop this sandbox.

   With this package you can play with MySQL 5.x without need of using
   other
   computers. The server installed in the sandbox use non-standard
   ports and sockets, so that they won't interfere with existing MYSQL
   installations.

REQUIREMENTS

     * Linux or FreeBSD operating system (it may work in other *NIX OSs,
       but has not been tested)
     * MySQL 3.23 or later
     * Perl 5.8.1 or later (for installation only)
     * bash shell

INSTALLATION

   Unpack the necessary MySQL binaries somewhere under your home
   directory, and give it a
   convenient name (e.g. /opt/mysql/5.1.10, or $HOME/binaries/5.1.10 )

   Unpack the distribution package in one empty directory and run the
   install script. For example:
   $ ./install.pl -f sandbox.conf --basedir=$HOME/binaries/5.1.10

   You can create the data directory in two ways:
     * using mysql_install_db script. In this case, the sandbox will run
       an additional script to install username and password in the
       database.
       install.pl --datadir_from=script

     * copying from an already existing directory (you need to have the
       necessary privileges to read fies from the origin)
       install.pl --datadir_from=dir:/usr/local/mysql/data/mysql

   To see the available options, run ./install.pl --help

EXPRESS INSTALLATION

   For frequent usage, there is a convenient script,
   ./express_install.pl,
   which can speed up the installation process beyond imagination, but
   requires some defaults to be set.

     * ./express_install.pl x.x.xx
       Where x.x.xx is a version number (e.g. 5.0.45)
       Assumes that there is a directory x.x.xx under the default base
       directory (/opt/mysql), containing an expanded tarball.
       You can override the default directory by setting the environment
       variable BINARY_BASE

     * ./express_install.pl /path/to/x.x.xx
       same as above, but giving the complete path to the expanded
       tarball.
       The directory must be named with a version number

     * ./express_install.pl /path/to/server_tarball.tar.gz
       This will expand the tarball, rename the directory with the
       appropriate version number, and then proceed with the normal
       installation.

   use ./express_install.pl --help for more options

REPLICATION INSTALL

   Starting with version 1.9, the MySQL Sandbox can also set a
   replication system. By default, set_replication.pl will install 1 master 
   and two slaves, under $HOME/rsandbox.
   The number of slaves can be changed by setting an appropriate option.
   ./set_replication.pl should be started with the same paradigm accepted
   by
   express_install.pl

   ./set_replication.pl x.x.xx
   ./set_replication.pl /path/to/x.x.xx
   ./set_replication.pl /path/to/server_tarball.tar.gz

   use ./set_replication.pl --help for more options

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

   All programs in the Sandbox suite recognize and uses the following
   variables:
     * HOME the user's home directory
     * USER the operating system user
     * PATH the execution path
     * DEBUG if set, the programs will print debugging messages

   In addition to the above, express_installi.pl will use
   * BINARY_BASE the directory containing the installation server
   binaries

   set_replication.pl will recognize the following
   * MASTER_OPTIONS additional options to be passed to the master
   * SLAVE_OPTIONS additional options to be passed to each slave

USAGE

   Change directory to the newly created one (default:
   $HOME/mysql_sandboxVERSION)

   Start the server
   ./start.sh

   Stop the server
   ./start.sh

   use a client with the sandbox server:
   ./use.sh
