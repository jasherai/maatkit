mysql-visual-explain is easy to install.  Follow one of these methods:

===== INSTALL FROM A TARBALL

If you install from the tarball, extract the tarball and go into the resulting
directory:

   tar zxvf <package>-<version>.tar.gz
   cd <package>-<version>

Generate the makefile, which will check Perl module dependencies and so forth:

   perl Makefile.PL

Install the program and man page:

   make install

To remove the files, simply run:

   make uninstall

To install to a directory other than your system's default, such as your home
directory, generate the Makefile with a prefix:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

===== ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS

Simply unpack the zip or tarball file from Sourceforge and run the scripts from
within a command prompt.
