2008-07-28:

   * Added to MySQL instance report: InnoDB buffer pool size and Problems
	section
   * Added: --show-indexes, otherwise indexes are not counted until parsing
	SHOW CREATE TABLE is implemented later
   * Fixed: conf_system_vars didn't have valueless opts like
	--skip-name-resolve (wrong regex) and didn't change - to _
   * Implemented: gets innodb_buffer_pool_size from status vals if MySQL
	v5.0.2+ or from config file for earlier versions
   * Changed: shorten() can treat 1k as 1_024 or 1_000 and removes precision
	on numbers < 1_000 (copied from mysqlreport)
   * Implemented: check_MySQL_instance_for_problems()--to be populated later
	w/ more checks
   * Changed: how number of physical CPUs is determined from:
	      $cores / max( $info =~ m/cpu cores\s+: (\d+)/gm);
	  to: `grep 'physical id' /proc/cpuinfo | sort | uniq | wc -l`;

2008-07-26:

   * Implemented: index counts: for all dbs and engines summary
   * Implemented: engines summary (# tables & indexes, size data and indexes)
   * Implemented: --top

2008-07-25:

   * Implemented: --user, --password and --askpass options
   * Added to server specs report: memory slots (requires root access), LVM
	volume groups (vgs)
   * Added to MySQL instance report: data size, index size, rows and engine to
	top N largest tables, syslog Yes/No
   * Implemented: check most /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ vals against defaults (from

   * Replaced: Data::Dumper w/ formats, SERVER and MYSQL_INSTANCE
   * Code refactoring: server_report(), mysql_instance_reports()
   * Implemented: for each instance report: version, uptime, location of
	config file and error, slow and relay logs, if slow logging is ON/OFF,
	long query time
