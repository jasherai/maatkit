Module-ify (and keep up with it):

* quote_identifier doesn't work right.  See mysql-archiver (I think).

Pipe output from duplicate-key-checker into another tool to graph structures 
   (check out dot for graphing)
mysqldiff: http://www.adamspiers.org/computing/mysqldiff/

query sniper:
   * http://www.stillhq.com/mysql/000008.html
   * Allow up to max_connections-X connections
   * Specify users/hosts NOT to kill (by default root/localhost)
mysql-relay-prefetch: read ahead in the binlog (SHOW BINLOG EVENTS) and rewrite queries and pre-warm the cache.
* read binlogs from many servers and apply them to one.

Wrapper around netcat file copies
wrapper to discover LVM and take/release snapshots

Swallow a log file and output only the selected fields.  This could be piped
to a colorizer or pushed into mysql-query-profiler.

Log parsing and coloring:

Promoting masters:
   * compare positions
   * choose slave that's most up-to-date
   * use SHOW BINARY LOG EVENTS and some math to find the corresponding
     positions and issue CHANGE MASTER TO on each slave.
